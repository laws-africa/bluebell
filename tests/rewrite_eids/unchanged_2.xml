The Strategy explores a number of voluntary ways and means that are aimed at creating a coherent and sustainable approach to technology transfer and scientific and technological cooperation, in accordance with the provisions of the Convention, and relevant international and domestic obligations.</p>

                  <p eId="att_1__dvs_I__para_2__p_1">The present framework identifies strategic activities for the practical implementation of the programme of work on technology transfer and scientific and technological cooperation. The programme of work was adopted by the Conference of the Parties at its seventh meeting held in Kuala Lumpur in February 2004, in order to develop meaningful and effective action to enhance the implementation of Articles 16 to 19 as well as related provisions of the Convention, by promoting and facilitating the transfer of and access to technologies from developed to developing countries as well as among developing countries and other Parties. According to Article 16 paragraph 1, of the Convention, relevant technologies under the Convention are those that contribute to meeting the three objectives of the Convention, that is, technologies that are relevant to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity or make use of genetic resources and do not cause significant damage to the environment.</p>

                  <p eId="att_1__dvs_I__para_3__p_1">Biodiversity is under massive and increasing pressure as a result of global changes such as population growth, poverty alleviation, reduction of available arable land and water, environmental stress, climate change, and the need for renewable resources, and this requires that the full range of technologies, ranging from traditional to modern technologies, is made widely available in order to address the challenges associated with the implementation of the three objectives of the Convention. Much scientific and technological cooperation, including the transfer of technologies, is already being undertaken, in particular on a smaller scale. The present strategy aims to increase the visibility of such cooperation, and to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of technology transfer and scientific and technological cooperation under the Convention.</p>

                  <p eId="att_1__dvs_II__para_4__p_1">It is important to recognize the crucial <b>links between technology transfer and scientific and technological cooperation</b> – the two elements addressed by the programme of work. Technology transfer, in particular in the context of the third objective of the Convention, will not be effective as an on-off and one-way activity, but needs to be <b>embedded in a participatory decision-making process</b> as well as in <b>integrated, long-term scientific and technological cooperation,</b> which may involve the joint development of new technologies and, as based on reciprocity, would also provide a key mechanism for the effective building or enhancement of capacity in developing countries and countries with economies in transition.</p>

                  <p eId="att_1__dvs_II__para_5__p_1">The concrete process leading to technology transfer, as well as the cooperative mechanisms applied, will necessarily differ in accordance with the largely varying socio-economic and cultural conditions among countries, as well as the type of technologies transferred. Hence, this process needs to be <b>flexible, participatory, and demand-driven,</b> moving along different cells of matrices of potential types of technologies and cooperative mechanisms.</p>

                  <p eId="att_1__dvs_II__para_6__p_1">The concept of technology as generally understood under the Convention includes both <b>“hard” and “soft” technology</b>. The notion of hard technology refers to the actual machinery and other physical hardware that is transferred, while the category of soft technology refers to technological information or know-how. Such “soft” technology is often transferred within long-term scientific and technological cooperation including though joint research and innovation which move ideas from invention to new products, processes and services.</p>

                  <p eId="att_1__dvs_II__para_8__p_1">Strategic activities can be distinguished according to whether they focus on fostering the <i>provision</i> of technologies or on the <i>reception, adaptation and diffusion</i> of technologies. While many countries may be mainly providing or mainly receiving technologies, it has to be borne in mind that individual countries may sometimes simultaneously provide and receive technologies from abroad. The programme of work recognizes that <b>enabling environments are necessary in both developed and developing countries</b> as a tool to promote and facilitate the successful and sustainable transfer of technologies for the purpose of the Convention on Biological Diversity. Consequently, the strategic elements identified below cover measures to be taken both on the providing as well as on the receiving end.</p>

                  <p eId="att_1__dvs_II__para_9__p_1">Development of a strategy for implementing the programme of work on technology transfer and scientific and technological cooperation suggests applying a rational, structured approach. However, the reality of effective technology transfer is to take advantage of opportunities as they arise, implying that the <b>implementation of the strategy should not delay the immediate transfer of relevant technologies</b> in those cases where technology needs and opportunities are identified and the institutional, administrative, policy and legal environment does not prevent their successful transfer and adaptation.</p>

For example, the Climate Technology Initiative (CTI), which was launched in 1995 by 23 OECD/International Energy Agency member countries and the European Commission to support the technology-related objectives of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, indicates the useful role of such an international network of champions for the effective implementation of provisions on technology transfer. The establishment of a similar <b>‘Biodiversity Technology Initiative’</b> would be useful and welcome if effectively contributing to the implementation of the present strategy. Several open questions remain, including on the funding needs, the potential portfolio of activities, and other questions as identified in the report prepared by the Executive Secretary for consideration by the ninth meeting of the Conference of the Parties. <sup><authorialNote eId="att_1__dvs_VI__para_30__p_1__authorialNote_1" marker="1" placement="bottom"><p eId="att_1__dvs_VI__para_30__p_1__authorialNote_1__p_1">UNEP/CBD/COP/9/18/Add. 1.</p></authorialNote></sup></p>
