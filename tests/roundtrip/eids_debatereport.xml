The Strategy explores a number of voluntary ways and means that are aimed at creating a coherent and sustainable approach to technology transfer and scientific and technological cooperation, in accordance with the provisions of the Convention, and relevant international and domestic obligations.</p>

                  <p eId="att_1__dvs_I__para_2__p_1">The present framework identifies strategic activities for the practical implementation of the programme of work on technology transfer and scientific and technological cooperation. The programme of work was adopted by the Conference of the Parties at its seventh meeting held in Kuala Lumpur in February 2004, in order to develop meaningful and effective action to enhance the implementation of Articles 16 to 19 as well as related provisions of the Convention, by promoting and facilitating the transfer of and access to technologies from developed to developing countries as well as among developing countries and other Parties. According to Article 16 paragraph 1, of the Convention, relevant technologies under the Convention are those that contribute to meeting the three objectives of the Convention, that is, technologies that are relevant to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity or make use of genetic resources and do not cause significant damage to the environment.</p>

                  <p eId="att_1__dvs_I__para_3__p_1">Biodiversity is under massive and increasing pressure as a result of global changes such as population growth, poverty alleviation, reduction of available arable land and water, environmental stress, climate change, and the need for renewable resources, and this requires that the full range of technologies, ranging from traditional to modern technologies, is made widely available in order to address the challenges associated with the implementation of the three objectives of the Convention. Much scientific and technological cooperation, including the transfer of technologies, is already being undertaken, in particular on a smaller scale. The present strategy aims to increase the visibility of such cooperation, and to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of technology transfer and scientific and technological cooperation under the Convention.</p>

                  <p eId="att_1__dvs_II__para_4__p_1">It is important to recognize the crucial <b>links between technology transfer and scientific and technological cooperation</b> – the two elements addressed by the programme of work. Technology transfer, in particular in the context of the third objective of the Convention, will not be effective as an on-off and one-way activity, but needs to be <b>embedded in a participatory decision-making process</b> as well as in <b>integrated, long-term scientific and technological cooperation,</b> which may involve the joint development of new technologies and, as based on reciprocity, would also provide a key mechanism for the effective building or enhancement of capacity in developing countries and countries with economies in transition.</p>
